My initiation into programming using "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" book by Al Sweigart.

I took up the Python programming language to begin my transition out of a personal interest in "big data" and automation. Beyond that, it kept creeping up in developer conversations on Twitter every now and again. Knowing that there was a thriving community of Pythonistas in my native Ghana, as well as the African continent by extension, made it the more appealing. Support is key. That said, I'm looking forward to making every step in this journey count. Here's to making  meaningful contributions to the global community in the not-so-distant future.

Credit to Kwadwo Adutwum (alias Optis Mistis) of the Scholarship Access Project for getting me started on this. I owe you one, chale!

What to expect in this README/Repository:

(a) Learning notes from my reading and understanding of the above named book as I journey through the pages.

(b) Code from practice excercises in the learning resource.

(c) Code written out of random thoughts (curiosity) about programming concepts/principles as I've come to understand them.
