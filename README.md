My initiation into programming using "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" book by Al Sweigart.

I took up the Python programming language to begin my transition out of a personal interest in "big data" and automation. Beyond that, it kept creeping up in developer conversations on Twitter every now and again. Knowing that there was a thriving community of Pythonistas in my native Ghana, as well as the African continent by extension, made it the more appealing. Support is key and with that being said, I hope to make every step in this journey count and contribute meaningfully to the global community.

What to expect in this README/Repository:

(a) Learning notes from my reading and understanding of the above named book as I journey through the pages.

(b) Code from practice excercises in the learning resource.

(c) Code written out of random thoughts (curiosity) about programming concepts/principles as I've come to understand them.
